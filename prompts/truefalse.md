//bloom_taxonomy 
# **Bloom Level: 'Wissen'**

**Question Type:** True/False questions for recall-based tasks  
**Design Approach:**  
Focus on recognition and recall of basic facts.  
Questions should be straightforward and require the identification of accurate information or common misconceptions.

**Example:**  
**True or False:** The Swiss Federal Council consists of 7 members.  
**Correct Answer:** True  
**Explanation of False Option:**  
False would reflect a misunderstanding of the specific composition of the Swiss Federal Council, as 7 is the correct number. If a learner answers "False," they might be confusing this with other councils or governmental bodies with different membership numbers.

# **Bloom Level: 'Verstehen'**

**Question Type:** True/False questions that assess comprehension and interpretation  
**Design Approach:**  
The questions should assess a learner's ability to comprehend and explain ideas or concepts, possibly in relation to real-world examples. They need to understand the principles rather than just recalling information.

**Example:**  
**True or False:** Cantonal governments in Switzerland are responsible for managing the Swiss military.  
**Correct Answer:** False  
**Explanation of False Option:**  
True would reflect a misunderstanding, as the military is a federal responsibility. Learners answering "True" may confuse the roles of cantonal versus federal responsibilities, highlighting the need for a clearer understanding of Switzerland’s division of powers.

# **Bloom Level: 'Anwenden'**

**Question Type:** True/False questions that evaluate practical knowledge and application  
**Design Approach:**  
Questions should require learners to apply knowledge in new or practical situations. Include real-life scenarios where students use learned concepts to determine whether the statement is accurate or not.

**Example:**  
**True or False:** If a canton introduces an educational reform, it can proceed without federal approval, as education is entirely a cantonal matter.  
**Correct Answer:** False  
**Explanation of False Option:**  
True would indicate that a learner misunderstands the relationship between cantonal and federal powers. While cantons have significant autonomy over education, federal guidelines must still be respected, especially if reforms conflict with national policies.

---

# **Bloom Level: 'Analyse'**

**Question Type:** True/False questions focusing on analysis, comparison, or breakdown of information  
**Design Approach:**  
These questions should prompt learners to break down information, compare and contrast elements, or identify patterns. The aim is to push deeper analysis rather than just comprehension.

**Example:**  
**True or False:** Cantonal governments in Switzerland have the same level of authority over taxation as they do over education.  
**Correct Answer:** False  
**Explanation of False Option:**  
True would indicate confusion about the varying degrees of cantonal authority in different sectors. Education is predominantly under cantonal jurisdiction, whereas taxation involves both federal and cantonal regulations, depending on the type of tax. By answering correctly, the learner shows an understanding of the nuanced differences between these responsibilities.
